        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Oxana.</h1>
				<p> data scientist / startup engineer / teacher. </p>
<p>
I am an Engineer by training and a Creative by nature. I combine this two superpowers to create beautiful
visualizations and extract insights from data. With experience from both academia and the tech industry
I'm the person you need if you want to deliver a compelling message to your users or stakeholders. 
My background in web development and experience working for tech startups add to my data wizard toolbox.
I also enjoy sharing my passion for creating awesome things with code so I teach programming and data visualization. 

Does this just sound like a person you were looking for for months? I'm available for part-time projects, just 
<a href="mailto:oxananu@gmail.com">drop me an email</a>.

When I’m not coding or analyzing data, I teach and train swimming & triathlon (check out
<a href="http://stockholmswimmingclub.se">Stockholm International Swimming Club</a>) and raise my two sons. 
I also really enjoy spending time outside, exploring nature and all sorts of training.
