Hi there. I'm Oxana.

### data scientist / startup engineer / teacher.

I am an engineer by training and a creative by nature. I combine this two superpowers to create beautiful 
visualizations and extract insights from data. With experience from both academia and the tech industry I'm the person you need if you want to deliver a compelling message to your users or stakeholders.

My background in web development and experience working for tech startups add to my data wizard toolbox. I also enjoy sharing my passion for creating awesome things with code so I teach programming and data visualization. 

Does this sound like a person you are looking for? I'm available for part-time projects, 
just [drop me an email](mailto:oxananu@gmail.com).

When I’m not coding or analyzing data, I teach and train swimming & triathlon
(check out [Stockholm International Swimming Club](http://stockholmswimmingclub.se)).
