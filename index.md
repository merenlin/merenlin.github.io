Hi there. I'm Oxana, an innovative problem solver passionate about sustainability and life sciences, an engineer by training, and a creative by nature. 

Over the past 15 years I have worked for various tech and bioscience startups and as a researcher in academia. I have learned to combine the best of the two worlds. 

I also enjoy sharing my passion for creating awesome things with code so I teach programming, web development and other useful skills, currently at [LNU](http://lnu.se/).
