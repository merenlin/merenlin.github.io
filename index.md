Hi there. I'm Oxana. I am a Stockholm based developer with a passion for design and technology, - an engineer by training and a creative by nature. 

Over the past 10 years I have worked for various tech and bioscience startups and as a researcher in academia. I have learned to combine the best of the two worlds. I am currently obsessed with information design and data visualisation. 

I also enjoy sharing my passion for creating awesome things with code so I teach programming and data visualization.
