# Projects


Here are things I have done in the past few years or doing now, structured by the field of my interest.


**2023 - now**
**Sensor Data Analysis (Maritime and Energy)**

• **Internet of Things for Digital Transformation**  
 Contributed to IEEE COINS 2024 by focusing on IoT-driven digital transformation and sustainable growth for SMEs.

• **Maritime Navigation Project (COLREG3)**  
 Developed as part of my Postdoctoral work at Linnaeus University’s IoT Lab. This project focuses on sensor data analysis for maritime navigation. Further details are available at the [COLREG project](https://research.chalmers.se/publication/540274).

• **Future Energy Insights**  
 Designed time-series and deep learning models for city load forecasting by analysing sensor data, with a focus on energy prediction. Published in Applied Energy (2024). [DOI: 10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.124067](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2024.124067).

**e-Health**

• **Intelligent Wearable Project ("DiWAH" Study)**  
 – An initiative under my Postdoctoral role that applies sensor-based analytics to wearable devices for health monitoring. More information about the project can be found at the [Intelligent Wearable DiVA project](https://lnu.se/en/research/research-groups/linnaeus-university-centre-for-data-intensive-sciences-and-applications/seed-projects/seed-project-development-of-an-intelligent-wearable-the-diwah-study/).


**2018 – 2019**  
• Data Science Consultant at IBM Sweden, Stockholm, Sweden – Managed a team of data scientists and coordinated end-to-end projects, including machine learning, IoT data analysis, natural language processing, and MLOps.

**2014 – 2023**  
• Independent Data Science Consultant at Vildly AB, Sweden & Remote – Delivered key data engineering, analytics, and visualization solutions, including enhancements to interactive graph platforms (e.g. [Plot.ly Python API](https://github.com/plotly/python-api/pull/274) and Dash) and custom analytics for interactive platforms like Mentimeter.  Improved bar chart visualizations for [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/)

## Life Sciences & Bioinformatics

**2021 – 2023**  
• Researcher at ZHAW Zurich University of Applied Sciences (Remote) – Participated in the “Trans-omic Approach to Colorectal Cancer” project by developing a relational database, API, and pipeline for genotyping short tandem repeat (STR) mutations in cancer patients.  
  ◦ Key publication: "Short tandem repeat mutations regulate gene expression in colorectal cancer" with M. Verbiest and M. Anisimova, published in Nature Scientific Reports (2024) – [View publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-53739-0).  
  ◦ Also collaborated on statistical data analysis and pipeline development integrating sequencing data matching with image analysis – further details can be explored via the [Mucin Project](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34475526/).

**2012 – 2023**  
• PhD Research at Stockholm University/SciLifeLab, Sweden – Investigated intrinsic disorder in proteins relevant to human diseases and developed the WebSTR platform for large-scale biological and medical data sharing.

**2017**  
• "High GC content causes orphan proteins to be intrinsically disordered" [paper in PLOS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005375)

**2013**  
• "Evolution of disordered proteins" [paper in MBE Oxford journal](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/12/2645.short)

**2012–2013**  
• "Promoter architecture and expression breadth study with FANTOM5" [paper in Genome Biology journal](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0413-3#)
